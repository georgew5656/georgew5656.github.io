**Portugal**

I spent 11 nights in Portugal in September, arriving on a Saturday and leaving on a Wednesday, visiting Porto, Lisbon, and the southern coast (we stayed in Portimao around the de Rocha beach). If I had to say whether this period was too long or too short I would say it was slightly on the long side (I personally think Portimao can be skipped and that 3-4 nights each in Lisbon and Porto is sufficient), and one week with two weekends ought to be more than enough.

In general, the Porto -> Lisbon order of operations seems correct to me. Ideally one could fly open jaw into Porto and out of Lisbon, but we flew into Lisbon and immediately hopped onto a train to Porto.

**Porto**

The weather here was mostly pretty perfect, cool enough to feel comfortable putting in 4-5 hour periods outdoors with minimal rest and warm enough to walk around in a t-shirt or shorts (but perhaps not both).

In general I would say that Porto feels a lot more “Portuguese” than Lisbon (although I’m guessing that one might do even better looking for Portugal on the other side of the Atlantic in South America instead). This includes things such as under salted food, really great service at restaurants and shops, and a certain degree of rundown-ness (you can really see the population slimming down to a point where it no longer really fills in all of the built environment in the country). Even if the actual population has not shrunk, the elderly population tends to take up less space than you expect.

The light show at one of the local Catholic Churches was definitely worth seeing. This was my second show (the first one was in Montreal), and as a non-music festival guy myself I find these events fascinating. EDC crossed with classic Catholic vibes would not be an inaccurate descriptor.

The weather in general is beautiful. Porto can easily be described as San Francisco without all of the nonsense. The city is situated on a series of hills above the ocean and features all of the stunning sunsets and mornings of Northern California. There are wineries an hour or two away from Porto via rental car. For those who are interested and even for those who are not, I imagine these wineries are at least as nice as the ones in Northern California and definitely worth a trip. I was also sad to not see the interior of the country more. The wine tasting in Porto can be skipped unless you are a wine aficionado.

We spent most of a day on a day trip to Aviero, a pretty classic oceanside (but not beach) small town on the Atlantic. I personally would reccomend making a trip to at least one smaller town while in the country. I preferred Aviero to all of the towns on the southern coast that we later visited. The main attraction was the local university, which we did not get the chance to visit but did balance the population of the town with a punch of younger locals, something that was missing in other small towns. Aviero appears to be a common weekend destination for families from Porto, with a fairly substantial but nothing special by American standards indoor-outdoor mall serving as the center of town. The food court was PACKED with families on day trips, which brings me to the food.

There were definitely a few food highlights of the trip.

- A shockingly good North Indian place near Portimao (I ordered the chicken korma and as a butter chicken partisan, I was completely won over). In general the Indian food in Portugal is the most reliable ethnic food, you can’t help but notice that every small convenience store/stand is owned by a Indian man.
- A all you can eat barbecued fish place in Olhao. I personally am not a huge fan of grilled fish but I enjoyed this place a decent amount. Plus the food was all adequately salted, a theme I noticed by day two.
- A Thai restaurant in Lisbon (really good meatball and tofu soup with vegetables)

But in general I found the food pretty lacking. Portuguese food itself is heavy in ingredients over quality, generally relying on the quality of the proteins (often beef, sometimes seafood) over seasoning. Almost everything I had was undersalted. The ethnic food scene is nowhere near as developed as in the UK or even say the Netherlands. The class European sandwich/sausage roll is definitely present here but I would say the lack of seasoning and also variety of vegetables puts the casual food experience significantly below the median European country I have visited. I found myself eating at Mcdonalds more that I would at home here in a way that isn’t true in other European countries, as much as a I love sampling fast food in other countries.

I also found it difficult to order familiar coffee here, because Americanos, which are pretty easy to find in other European countries, are difficult to find or nonexistent in Portugal. By the end of the trip I had mostly Stockholm-syndromed myself into enjoying single-shot espressos.

I am not normally a dessert guy but the desserts in this country are decent to very good. Both the gelato and the egg darts are memorable and worth multiple tries.

**Lisbon**

The city itself feels much more generically European than Porto. This might ordinarily be a bad thing, but I found it refreshing after several days in more run down areas of the country. There are a lot more tourists and expats of all stripes in this country, but especially I noticed a lot of British, Germans, and Americans. Accordingly, the international food options were marginally better here than in Porto.

It seemed like every tourist in the city was with us on the day trip to Sintra. The classic route is to take the bus from the train station up to the royal summer palace and go on the tour through the building, but there was a huge line for this and I frankly found it not worth at all. As far as the popular tourist sites in Sintra go, the Quinta da Regaleira was much more worth it. My advice would be to skip the bus altogether and arrive prepared for a hike, and simply walk all the way up to the summer palace (skip the tour), and visit Quinta da Regalaria on the way down. There are some great views and photo opportunities here.

We went to the aquarium in Oriente and it was a great experience, better than most of the aquariums I’ve been to. We also didn’t make it up to the parks (the city is situated on a hill that descends to the river).
