I’ve pretty much been working out 5-6 days a week since I’ve turned 15. I think the benefits of exercise for someone with an otherwise pretty sedentary (student, office job) lifestyle are well documented, but especially for an overweight kid gaining confidence in the way I looked and moved was a big one.

I was a rower in high school (5-6 practices a week), so there wasn’t as much opportunity to try other things. It was basically cardio, cardio, and cardio with some bodyweight/calisthenics thrown in. This was certainly the period in my life where I was in the best cardiovascular shape + potentially when my core was strongest (at least until very recently).

In college I oscillated between a cardio heavy workload (mostly swimming, cycling, and jogging), and more of a traditional gym-bro profile with your classic powerlifting split. In general my weeks looked something like 3 cardio days (~45 mins) and 2 lifting days a week. In the weightroom I pretty much tried to hit full body everytime while approximating some concept of progressive overload. A day might have looked like:
- 10/10/8/8/6 back squat
- 5x6 deadlifts
- 10/10/8/8/6 bench press
- 4 sets of pullups
- 4 sets of dumbbell rows
- 4 sets of dumbbell shoulder press

There was no mobility or core built in at all. This was obviously the period in my life when I was making the most progress in terms of  lifting heavy weight. I would guess my back squat/deadlift/bench probably all went up 2x during the four years in college. I probably also gained ~10-15 pounds over this period of time. In terms of cardio I was definitely significantly off my personal bests during high school, but after the initial falloff I wasn’t particularly getting worse over time. Plateauing is probably an accurate word to describe me.

Would I recommend this kind of split to someone new to lifting? For a younger guy who just wants to keep things simple this program would probably be pretty effective. I would throw in one form of weighted core work because weighted core work is actually awesome and really helps prevent injury. In general though this kind of program definitely can cause some muscle imbalance issues and you won’t be beating the “gym strength only” allegations with this kind of routine.

After college, I slowly started replacing the lifts in my college program with new ones and introduced additional mobility work. For a long time my workout split was the same (3-4 cardio and 2 lifting days). Some lifts that I introduced that really worked for me and stuck.
Front squats or zercher squats. If you can do zercher squats I would highly recommend them as they have helped with my “real world” strength the most and have helped my legs stay strong without imbalancing my push/pull muscles as much (Eugene Teo has a good video about this). I prefer front squats to back squats for most people as an alternative. If you have trouble with balancing or hitting depth while back squatting I would strongly recommend switching to front squats.
Grip strength work. Flex arm hangs, quarter pull ups, farmer carries, direct forearm work.
Weighted core work (as mentioned before). The two simplest exercises to get started with are the weighted decline sit-up (hold the weight above your head with your arms extended) and the crunch machine.
Direct back flexion work. Back extensions (weighted or unweighted), single leg RDL’s, good mornings.
Kettlebell circuits, e.g. kettlebell swings, kettlebell clean and jerks, kettlebell rows, kettlebell shoulder presses. It’s fine to do all these things with dumbbells as well but I find that kettlebells make it easier for me to get a full range of motion.
Power cleans (great for strength and power development).
One leg strength building. Split squats, lunges.

I also dropped a few things.
I don’t do the barbell bench press anymore. Instead I prefer  dips (weighted or not) and regular pushups. I think the dumbbell bench + cable flies  is also a good combination for training the chest.
I don’t back squat anymore (in favor of front squatting) and I rarely deadlift. This is mainly because these two lifts tend to take a long time and I’m not looking to max out my powerlifts any more.

A lower body focused workout I would do today might be
- 4 sets of zerchers
- 4 sets of bulgarian split squats
- 4 sets of box jumps
- Pull ups
- Dips
- Push ups
- Weighted core work
- Dumbbell rows
- Kettlebell swings
- Weighted lunges
- Some targeted foot and ankle work.

(For a upper body day I would replace the zerchers with a power clean and introduce several more kettlebell moves)
I try to spend 15 minutes twice a week on exercise specifically targeted at strengthening my foot and ankle strength to help with running. Sometimes I do this during my gym days and sometimes I do it in my apartment gym after running.  I would recommend runningability (ethan rasmussen) on instagram for inspiration here.

The other major change I’ve made is introducing pilates into my routine (mostly solidcore). I think in theory most people could probably skip this in favor of doing more core work in their lifting but I find doing solidcore a day a week helps a lot with consistency (I will admit that core is the first thing I skip at the gym if I’m running out of time). As I get older I get busier and the idea of an in and out 50 minute class starts to look a lot more appealing.

I have done some yoga in the past and I think it has definitely helped me with my balance and mobility, but I was really hoping it would help me more with my hip tightness/lower back soreness. Targeting my core and starting solidcore helped my hip tightness and lower back pain way more than the yoga did.

Overall, my workout split now looks like this, and is working pretty well for me. I spend less time working out each week than I ever have and I feel pretty good physically.
- Lifting 1-2x a week
- Solidcore 1x a week
- Cardio 2-3x a week
- Occasionally a yoga class
