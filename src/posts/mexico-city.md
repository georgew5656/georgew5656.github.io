We spent 5 days (Friday → Wednesday) in Mexico City recently, never leaving the greater metro area (We did do a quick pit stop to check out some pyramids, which is definitely worth doing for anyone interested in history)

**Transportation**

Making our way around Mexico City involved hours in Ubers, including various moments where I alternated between fearing for my life and wondering why all the cars were almost scratch-free. Maybe it’s better not to think about this too much.

We stuck to Uber’s mostly because I do not speak Spanish and Mexico City is not necessarily a place that you want to spend hours walking around unfamiliar roads in. This is not out of any concern for personal safety (walking around the city’s central neighborhoods felt no worse than any other North American city), but because the city is simply not a particularly fun place to spend large amounts of time walking from point to point, in the way that a city like New York can be.

Getting around within Mexico City is similar to getting around Los Angeles. You can get around LA via public transport, but it is simply a better experience to zip around in a car, as the city is built at automobile level scale. You see a greater variety of buildings and people driving than walking. Similarly to LA, there are various sections of the city that are very walkable, but you need a way to get from point A to point B.

**Food**

I would overall give the city a B+ for its food. The food experience was somewhat better than on my earlier trip to Portugal, and with significantly less effort required on our part. Whenever I travel somewhere without above average Korean and/or Chinese food I find myself wishing for access to any kind of leafy greens, and Mexico City was no different. For me, there’s only so much corn I can eat before I get tired of it.

The street food was very good, and did not give me the digestive trouble that I might have expected. You can have a great experience alternating between street vendors and lower end restaurant stalls without going into the nicer places, although I would recommend going to at least one higher end place ($$$ on google or above), because you will probably still pay under $50 USD for two people and get to see a different side of the city. For non-Mexican food, find a Japanese place. There was a lot of Japanese influence in Mexico for reasons I am unsure of (there were ads with Japanese models, many Japanese cars/trucks, and the aforementioned restaurants). The cultural power is really felt here!

Every drink I ordered was extremely good (I don’t drink alcohol). The aqua frescas, the Horchatas, and especially the hot chocolate made me rethink my strategy of rarely ordering anything to drink at restaurants. The coffee was a breath of fresh air compared to the (non) options in Portugal.

I most regret not ordering anything involving bread. The bakery scene here seems extremely strong, and many of the street vendors sell various things between a Baguette. I saw people carrying large bags of seemingly freshly baked bread to stalls but somehow never managed to order something (my lack of Spanish really hurt me here).

**Misc**

Mexico City seems to operate in two sections, with the first section mostly populated by white-passing Mexicans and the second tier populated by everyone else. The places where the latter congregated felt much more like China than anywhere else I’ve been to outside of East Asia. The places where the former frequented were very American. Mexico City somehow feels more like China and also more like the United State than most of the countries I have traveled to.

We made it out without unwillingly leaving anything , although I was certainly ripped off at tourist sites for food and water. I received the occasional second look from locals, but normally in the form of curiosity than hostility. In general, people in the city seem to be much more comfortable with racial ambiguity, as the city’s inhabitants span almost the entire spectrum of global diversity.

I found that the rule of “go to the commercial areas in Google Maps” was not very effective in Mexico City, as those places tended to be generic office buildings or plazas that you would expect to see downtown in any North American city. For architecture, go into residential areas. There will often be cute bakeries and/or coffee shops tucked away within the old Spanish buildings.

Overall, I think a long weekend is long enough for the city, and it was a good experience for me personally to stray slightly out of my comfort zone of traveling to East Asia or developed countries where people speak passable english. Definitely it was a relief to return home to an AQI below 50.
