# Living in the DMV

I’m moving out of the greater Washington DC area this summer to be closer to friends and family so I thought I’d post about my experience living here for over two years. Most of my time was spent in Northern Virginia, so my experiences are heavily NoVA flavored.

As far as places to live in the US go, the DMV was about as good as it gets for a yuppie like myself. (I think for other people a small town in New England/the Upper Midwest or a exurb of any growing city would make sense, but I have slightly different priorities). 

I say this due to the combination of availability of good jobs, relatively low cost of living for a coastal metro, general sense of stability and safety (especially for someone from the west coast), good transportation options, pretty decent weather, and really great options for food.

Most people would classify the entire NoVA area as suburban, but that term itself is starting to lose its meaning given the huge range between dense urban-suburban neighborhoods and more traditional suburban-exurban development.

Arlington itself is a classic highly built-up suburban area with lot sizes closer to 5000 square ft than the 10K or 15K you might find further away from the urban core. There are also a lot more legacy commercial corridors that sit very close to single family neighborhoods, and most of the neighborhood streets have through-traffic rather than being dead-ends.

Similar neighborhoods are North Berkeley, the west side of LA, North Jersey, and Chicagoland inner suburbs. The thing that separates this kind of neighborhood (still basically all single family zoned) from more planned suburban development (sterotypical suburban subdivisions) seems to be the average lot size.

When I think of the most pleasant places to live in the US, almost all of them share a common feature of having many single family homes on smaller lots. I think the US needs many many more 1000-1600 squareft single family houses in suburban neighborhoods. If I were working at a construction site automation company, I would want to focus on lowering the cost to build for this product type over anything else.

When I moved here from the west coast, I was shocked at how cheap things were. This was before most of the post-COVID price inflation, so I no longer feel this way about NoVA, but I suspect I would still be in for a nasty surprise at how expensive things are back on the west coast if I returned. If I had to guess, I’d attribute approximately half of these lower prices to income taxes replacing most of the sales tax (I’ve lived most of my life in Washington state), and the rest to lower labor costs and returns to scale and density.

The second part is more interesting to me. It seems to me that there is just a lot more institutional knowledge among service workers and the trades here, and I suspect that they are legitimately more productive than their peers on the West coast. Maybe there is some cultural thing in Seattle/the Bay Area where people do not stay in these types of jobs for as long and don’t build up the process knowledge that gets generated and transmitted out here.

It’s this process knowledge that I attribute the food being better in Northern Virginia to. I suspect that the average skill of staff you could hire for a kitchen here is simply higher than elsewhere. It’s true that the usual rules for finding good food still apply (Fancy restaurants are always worse on the value curve because you are paying for the decor and service, groups of restaurants together are usually better), but I get way better results here by simply randomly picking restaurants without many rules at all.

This is kind of a weird trade-off though, because it suggests that restaurants are better in places where there is a less competitive labor market and people stay in the industry longer because they have fewer options. If someone from here was willing to move out to Seattle for a job as a tradesman or service worker, from a economic point of view I would almost certainly highly recommend it, but it might be the lack of economic options that leads to the development of high levels of skill.

Finally, northern Virginia feels extremely safe to me for an area that actually has pretty high population density. It feels like law enforcement/the judicial system is actually functioning, the emergency services actually show up quickly when called, etc etc. In general, the area lacks most of the public nuisance problems that I’ve come to associate with blue cities.
