I was in Vegas for re:invent this week. Admittedly, a conference with tens of thousands of attendees may not be the best time to get a great understanding of a place, plus the Las Vegas strip ≠ Las Vegas (the fairly normal American city). But given the dozens of large conferences held in Vegas every year, it was at least representative of SOMETHING. The conference was definitely an accurate snapshot of AWS’s yearly revenue.

I landed at the airport at 10 PM and saw more ads for random software services than I’ve seen in my life, including when taking BART from SFO into the city. There are software services to manage configurations for other software services. I’m not sure if re:invent is the largest conference hosted every year in Vegas, but surely it’s in the top five or 10. There’s even a roped off area in the airport for you to get your badge. 

It’s pretty impressive how the Las Vegas strip seems to easily absorb the conference and carry on with no problems. I really don’t understand where they find all these people to staff the casinos. Skilled trades for maintenance, office workers for accounting and reservations, and an army of service workers. These are areas where it should be pretty competitive to hire in today’s economy but it feels like there’s absolutely no shortage of these people here. Is it possible that the expensive cost of living makes people work later than they would otherwise like to? In general, the older the casino, the older the staff. The employment situation is probably the most interesting part of the city. I think there must be some kind of informal network among the casinos where they can somehow find additional employees on short notice more effectively than in other employment markets.

It’s too dry for me to ever consider living here. I dislike dry weather, far more than extreme heat or extreme cold. This same issue would apply to e.g. the Inland Empire or Arizona for me. For people who enjoy that kind of thing and have an above average income, this seems like a great place to live. If we use gas prices as a rough proxy for metro COL (I find this actually works pretty well in the US), Las Vegas at ~5$/gallon is much more expensive than I expected, closer to coastal metropolis prices than Sun Belt prices. It makes sense that this is a common destination for well-off people leaving the Bay Area and especially Southern California. The food is very good and it’s a lot cleaner than most similarly sized American cities. Las Vegas is the solutions architect to Seattle’s software engineer.

I’ve never really thought of gambling addiction as a big problem, mostly because many people I know casually gamble without any real issues. I also struggle to see the issue with gambling as practiced in Las Vegas.. The stereotype of old people wasting time in the casinos mindlessly hitting slot machines is true, but it’s not like they do it year round. It seems like the local citizens of the city see the casinos as purely employment machines rather than actual places to hang out and lose their money. At the same time, it seems like a really bad idea to make this kind of mindless button pressing available instantly over mobile apps..

The most interesting talk I saw was by a battery manufacturer (Northvolt) about their compute infrastructure strategy. I know very little about how most industrial manufacturers choose the compute for their factories, but I had always assumed we were talking about either custom hardware deployed directly alongside machines made by companies like Siemens or on-premise compute deployed in nearby data centers. I would also expect a strict differentiation between control software and corporate software. A cloud strategy might involve migrating your cold data pipeline into the cloud for generating monthly reports, but not anything thats actually sending control requests to your PLCs on the machines.

Northvolt built their new factory with no on-prem servers at all. They are using souped up networking Raspberry Pis connected to each PLC that are responsible for both parsing the telemetry output into a reasonable format and sending it to the cloud and for receiving control signals from the control plane. Their control plane is deployed as a bunch of AWS Lambda functions that respond to this telemetry data and send commands back. The PIs are deployed as a huge K3s cluster to facilitate deployment.

AWS in general seemed to be putting in a lot of effort into expanding in two directions, given that they have locked down market share for enterprise software and for new startup spend. The first is for industrial applications. In general, it seems like their strategy is to convince firms to send cold/warm data to AWS and serve applications from there, although they also seem to be moving in the direction of shipping some custom hardware.

The second area is for HPC/academic and industrial research. Obviously a lot of people are trying to run large statistical models for everything from language to drug discovery to simulations. Aside from the issue of price (I assume it would still be preferable for many academics to just run a GPU on their own), this actually does seem like the perfect use case for the cloud.

In many ways, web services are actually the most finicky, difficult thing to run on the cloud. They have to be always available and they have little tolerance for downtime or resource contention. Comparatively, a fusion simulation can run at midnight on spot instances as easily as at noon. It can easily take advantage of more nodes (and they can be quickly scaled down afterwards). In general, a lot of the problems you run into running web services on the cloud are geared around preparing for worst case scenarios, and these kinds of things are simply not a problem with a lot of HPC applications. Hooray for one 7 of uptime.

It was pretty interesting how many former chemical or electrical engineers were employed by AWS as consultants selling software to firms in their old industries. Twenty years ago, the move from chemical engineering to software was trivially a smart decision for your sanity and compensation. Today, I am not sure that the tradeoff is as simple.
