# Zombie Companies

I’ve heard the following line of analysis a lot in the past year. 

“Underinvestment in excess capacity was caused by PTSD inspired by many firms overinvesting before 2008 and subsequently failing. Everyone left was by nature conservative and unwilling to take risks with capital.”

I’ve never totally been convinced by this argument. It sounds like a good argument, but presupposes everyone in e.g. the timber industry, is a moron. Surely someone would have tried to zag while everyone else was zigging and tried to buy up unused lumberyard capacity, in say, 2011. It’s not like computer chips, which are a famously cyclical industry because of how long it takes to make new capital investments.

I was reading **Diary of a Very Bad Year** (memoirs of the 2008 financial crisis) and came across an explanation of why zombie companies are long-term bad for the economy that filled the missing link in the oversupply → failure → underinvestment → undersupply argument.

A zombie company is a company that is functionally bankrupt. They are most likely still producing a product and making revenue, but the total future value of all this revenue + whatever assets they own are less than their liabilities. As an oversimplification, these liabilities are owned by a bank. Ordinarily, you would think the bank would be incentivized to demand repayment of these liabilities, trigger the zombie’s bankruptcy, and then recoup whatever they can from their investment. 

The book notes that many banks prefer not to do this, because banks are mostly reputation based and are asymmetrically hurt by publicizing bad news (there are probably multiple reasons beyond this, e.g. general human loss aversion). What the banks will do in this situation instead is hold the liabilities on their books indefinitely. This way the loan owed by the zombie to the bank can still be marked at full value.

However, the bank internally still has to treat this asset as though its value is something between the marked value and 0 (whatever it could theoretically recover in the zombie’s bankruptcy), and so the bank doesn’t make other, more productive loans, in order to defend this position. If a single bank accumulates enough of these positions, it becomes a zombie bank. This pattern, repeated with many zombie companies is what can lead to underinvestment in the overall economy and partially explains the situation in Japan in the 90’s.

This analogy can be applied to other situations. For example, a big tech company makes a big investment into a new product line that doesn’t pay off, but instead of writing the product line off, they pretend things are fine and refuse to make investments into other product lines to cover their butts. 

This general line of thinking might help explain why we didn’t e.g. recover lost lumber yard capacity after 2008. Most of the banks were not comfortable putting additional capital into the industry and so none of the remaining live players were able to expand when times were good. Add a spike of demand in 2021 and you get shortages.
