We were in Thailand (Chiang Mai and Bangkok) for 12 days at the beginning of February, it was the first time I’ve been to Southeast Asia so I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect.

On the one hand, I’ve been told that Thailand is a wonderful place that combines being friendly to tourists and expats and maintaining self-confidence in its own culture and history (Thailand is notably the only country in Southeast Asia to be able to make the claim that it has never been colonized).

On the other hand there are the classic stereotypes you see about Thailand. White Lotus, single guys mysteriously choosing to base themselves there, and overtourism.

In general I found Thailand to be closer to the former than the latter, but it does seem to be hitting the limit of how much tourism can actually generate for the economy without negative externalities + I am not sure what being a successful country in the Chinese industrial supply chain really looks like (maybe more like Vietnam than Thailand?).

I was surprised to learn on this trip that according to most measures, Thailand has the highest population of 华人 of any country outside the mainland itself and Taiwan. I think this may be because Thai Chinese don’t maintain their own micro-state like in Singapore or serve as a obvious minority group (separated by both religion and ethnicity) like in Malaysia/Indonesia.

Most of the migration to Thailand was from many years ago and Thai Chinese have generally integrated fully into Thai society, so I rarely heard the languages (cantonese, hokkien) that I might ordinarily expect to hear in a overseas Chinese community.

Mandarin Chinese (spoken by expats, tourists, and the local thais who were adapting to market demand) was much more common. I actually found that Thai people often spoke better Chinese than English, both in the obvious tourist hotspots and outside of them.

Of the two places I visited, Bangkok was a pretty normal Asian city, perhaps slightly more tourist friendly than most because of the luxurious accommodations for each price point. Western tourists (there were almost no Chinese tourists there because it was the week before CNY) tended to stay in their hotels/resorts, often barely leaving them at all, and also tended to be majority (80-90%) European. I was surprised by the lack of Australian tourists but less so by the lack of American tourists. The calculus of flying an extra 20 hours to get to Thailand instead of the Caribbean/Mexico doesn’t seem worth it, plus Americans are more comfortable in Spanish than Thai.

Chiang Mai was strange. The old town appears to be plurality (majority?) foreigners, with even nearby places outside of the old town center leaning this direction. Most of these people were tourists, but there was a significant chunk of people (including young people) that were not. It feels like some middle class young Europeans are taking advantage of the safety and quality of life in Thailand, sort of like a European Mexico City or maybe a tropical Dubai (although I did also get the impression that a lot of these people were not gainfully employed).

Total luxury boomer communism was fully in effect, on my flight (a a320 with 150 people) from Chiang Mai to Bangkok me and my wife were two of ~20 people who appeared to be under the age of 60.

Economically Chiang Mai still seems to be heavily dependent on resource extraction (mostly agriculture) and tourism. This did not appear to be the case in Bangkok, where one sees many Chinese and Japanese electronics and industrial manufacturers and suppliers and the vibe is a lot more China circa 2003.

The EV revolution has not really hit Thailand yet. Japanese cars are overwhelmingly dominant both in terms of cars on the road and new car sales. Where there were EVs they did tend to be Chinese brands, but it seems to me that the charging infrastructure is just not ready for mass transition in Thailand.

Japanese culture in general seems to have a very strong presence here. Beyond the cars, most luxury malls (and there are many) had a whole floor of Japanese restaurants and cafes and they appeared to be preferred by well-off Thais. In contrast, well-off/hip Thai people did not appear to frequent street eateries as much. From doing some research, It also seems to be the goal of many young Thais to move to Japan, drawn by the culture and higher wages. If you combine Japanese and Korean cultural impact (Blackpink Lisa obviously features prominently on many ads), their prominence far exceeds Western or American cultural impact here.

If I think about major American cultural exports that are still going pretty strong, I think of country music, football (especially college football), baseball, SF Bay Area effective altruism/substack culture  and maybe some form of Miami crypto/sports betting culture. Of these it feels like only the last has kind of landed in Thailand.

Overall, I would be bullish on Thailand’s seemingly good ability to absorb foreign influence (the Chinese community is a good example), and I believe it’ll continue to be a destination for westerners looking for a higher quality of life, but I expect it will likely also get old before getting rich and settle into some kind of middle income economy resembling e.g. Mexico.
